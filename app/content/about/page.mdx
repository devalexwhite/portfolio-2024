</div>

I'm a passionate frontend engineer and designer based in Hilliard, Ohio. With over 10 years of software development experience and 3 years in product design, I specialize in crafting beautiful, highly functional web interfaces. I excel in user research, design thinking, and coding with modern frontend technologies. I'm an entrepreneur at heart, having built numerous startups and currently running Darn Fine Software LLC.

## My Career Journey

### Driving Innovation from an Early Age

My passion for building software started when I was 12, coding games on an Atari 400. This early experience ignited a lifelong love of creating digital products, even leading to my own software agency.

### College

I went to Ohio University and majored in Computer Science (big surprise). I was a member of the local Association for Computing Machinery club and worked as a frontend developer for the Voinovich School of Leadership at Ohio University. In 2012 I spent a semester abroad in Tokyo, Japan at Musashi University (æ­¦è”µå¤§å­¦) and participated as a Tsunami relief volunteer in Iwate Prefecture (å²©æ‰‹çœŒ).

### Professional Expertise

Since graduating in 2015, I've thrived in various frontend-focused development roles across multiple companies. My commitment to the development community is evident through my leadership in the Frontend Columbus meetup and speaking engagements at conferences like ng-conf and CodeMash.
